# Game-of-Nim

A project that implements the Game of Nim developed in C++/Qt.
The game supports:

* 2 players
* 1 player playing against computer

In Case of playing against the computer, computer moves follow an optimal winning strategy based on Grundy Theorem, if the computer is in a losing position, it does a random move.

# Further work to be done:

* Add hover effect when hovering over the squares
* Modify the shape of the square
* Add a slow down effect when removing squares
